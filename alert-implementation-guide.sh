# Alert Implementation Summary Script
# This script provides a comprehensive guide for implementing alerts throughout the project

echo "=== ALERT SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE ==="
echo ""
echo "The following components have been updated with the new alert system:"
echo ""

echo "âœ… COMPLETED:"
echo "1. /src/hooks/useAlert.ts - Custom hook for alert management"
echo "2. /src/utils/navigation.ts - Utility for delayed navigation with alerts"
echo "3. /src/pages/Tasks/AddTask.tsx - Task creation with success/error alerts"
echo "4. /src/pages/Applications/add.tsx - Application creation with alerts"
echo "5. /src/pages/Applications/view.tsx - Application ping/delete with alerts"
echo ""

echo "ðŸ”„ STILL NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION:"
echo "1. /src/pages/Applications/edit.tsx - Application editing with alerts"
echo "2. /src/pages/Applications/applications.tsx - Application deletion in list"
echo "3. /src/pages/Login/LoginForm.tsx - Already has alerts, update to new system"
echo "4. /src/pages/Logs/LogsPage.tsx - Already has alerts, update to new system"
echo ""

echo "ðŸ“‹ IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN:"
echo ""
echo "1. Import required dependencies:"
echo "   import { Alert } from 'abolaji-ux-kit';"
echo "   import { useAlert } from '../../hooks/useAlert';"
echo "   import { showAlertAndNavigate } from '../../utils/navigation';"
echo ""
echo "2. Add hook to component:"
echo "   const { alert, showSuccess, showError, clearAlert } = useAlert();"
echo ""
echo "3. Update API calls:"
echo "   try {"
echo "     await mutation.mutateAsync(data);"
echo "     showAlertAndNavigate("
echo "       showSuccess,"
echo "       navigate,"
echo "       'Success message',"
echo "       '/redirect-path',"
echo "       'Success Title',"
echo "       3000"
echo "     );"
echo "   } catch (error) {"
echo "     showError('Error message', 'Error Title');"
echo "   }"
echo ""
echo "4. Add Alert component to UI:"
echo "   {alert && ("
echo "     <div className='mb-6'>"
echo "       <Alert"
echo "         variant={alert.type}"
echo "         title={alert.title}"
echo "         dismissible"
echo "         onClose={clearAlert}"
echo "       >"
echo "         {alert.message}"
echo "       </Alert>"
echo "     </div>"
echo "   )}"
echo ""

echo "âš¡ FEATURES:"
echo "- Automatic 3-second delay before navigation on success"
echo "- Consistent error handling with user-friendly messages"
echo "- Dismissible alerts with close functionality"
echo "- Typed alert states (success, error, warning, info)"
echo "- Centralized alert management through custom hook"
echo ""

echo "ðŸŽ¯ NEXT STEPS:"
echo "Run this in VS Code to implement remaining components:"
echo "1. Open each file listed in 'STILL NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION'"
echo "2. Follow the implementation pattern above"
echo "3. Test each API call for proper alert display"
echo "4. Verify 3-second delay before navigation works"
